Review,y
simplistic ,0
it's so laddish and juvenile ,0
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . ,0
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study ,0
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . ,0
the story is also as unoriginal as they come ,0
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . ,0
not so much farcical as sour . ,0
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . ,0
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders ,0
a sentimental mess that never rings true . ,0
while the performances are often engaging ,0
interesting ,0
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant ,0
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock ,0
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid,0
nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this ,0
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue ,0
here ,0
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . ,0
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . ,0
on its own ,0
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . ,0
a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise ,0
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer ,0
the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville . ,0
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . ',0
the criticism never rises above easy ,0
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving ,0
stupid ,0
somewhere in the middle ,0
the action clichés just pile up . ,0
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process ,0
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . ,0
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . ,0
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . ,0
please ,0
most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay ,0
 . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie ,0
curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . ,0
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors ,0
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . ,0
the effort is sincere and the results are honest ,0
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes ,0
with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity ,0
stinks from start to finish ,0
to the civilized mind ,0
equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . ,0
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . ,0
everything is off . ,0
when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit ,0
an easy watch ,0
imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story ,0
pc stability notwithstanding ,0
forget the misleading title ,0
an odd ,0
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled ,0
pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . ,0
a static and sugary little half-hour ,0
watching the chemistry between freeman and judd ,0
 . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . ,0
the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately ,0
the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long ,0
the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . ,0
mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . ,0
only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . ,0
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues ,0
 . . . plays like a badly edited ,0
maybe leblanc thought ,0
what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . ,0
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time,0
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that ,0
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . ,0
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again ,0
earnest but heavy-handed . ,0
if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . ,0
too slow for a younger crowd ,0
"there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . "" the adventures of pluto nash "" is a big time stinker . ",0
a punch line without a premise ,0
takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe ,0
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . ,0
even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate ,0
sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . ,0
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please ,0
deadly dull ,0
with this new rollerball ,0
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off,0
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room ,0
sex ironically has little to do with the story ,0
the script covers huge ,0
a portrait of alienation so perfect ,0
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . ,0
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . ,0
feels like a cold old man going through the motions . ,0
dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? ,0
dull and mechanical ,0
there's no point of view ,0
beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . ,0
has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . ,0
the gags ,0
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . ,0
narratively ,0
there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . ,0
directors john musker and ron clements ,0
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place ,0
there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan ,0
despite engaging offbeat touches ,0
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . ,0
the movie is a mess from start to finish . ,0
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than ,0
i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures ,0
in the telling of a story largely untold ,0
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish ,0
terminally brain dead production . ,0
some episodes work ,0
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . ,0
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie ,0
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre ,0
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny ,0
wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . ,0
off the hook is overlong and not well-acted ,0
it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . ,0
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death ,0
it's also curious to note that this film ,0
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa ,0
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . ,0
the problem is not that it's all derivative ,0
there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . ,0
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . ,0
a processed comedy chop suey . ,0
as spent screen series go ,0
fails as a dystopian movie ,0
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . ,0
an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling ,0
the movie ,0
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . ,0
if you value your time and money ,0
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions ,0
everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . ,0
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . ,0
the cameo-packed ,0
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba ,0
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . ,0
so genial is the conceit ,0
even in the summertime ,0
what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity ,0
one lousy movie . ,0
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character ,0
plodding ,0
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers ,0
oozes condescension from every pore . ,0
"solaris "" is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . ",0
the direction ,0
 . . . hypnotically dull . ,0
though this saga would be terrific to read about ,0
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . ,0
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and ,0
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions ,0
[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang ,0
occasionally loud and offensive ,0
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding,0
by the time you reach the finale ,0
journalistically dubious ,0
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . ,0
 at its best ,0
exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . ,0
calculated swill . ,0
this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . ,0
with or without ballast tanks ,0
director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . ,0
you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . ,0
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor ,0
walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . ,0
this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . ,0
it leers ,0
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . ,0
one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . ,0
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . ,0
fear permeates the whole of stortelling ,0
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . ,0
thoroughly awful . ,0
 . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory ,0
though the film is well-intentioned ,0
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . ,0
the video work is so grainy and rough ,0
truly terrible . ,0
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . ,0
it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . ,0
an achingly enthralling premise ,0
it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her ,0
rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . ,0
fluffy and disposible . ,0
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . ,0
if you go into the theater expecting a scary ,0
holds limited appeal to those who like explosions ,0
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . ,0

what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . ,0
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness ,0
bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense ,0
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references ,0
imagine kevin smith ,0
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . ,0
what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard ,0
it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . ,0
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . ,0
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . ,0
with the exception of mccoist ,0
the whole affair is as predictable as can be . ,0
a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . ,0

star trek was kind of terrific once ,0
[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate ,0
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance ,0
puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . ,0

despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth ,0
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure ,0
gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . ,0
a sham construct based on theory ,0
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . ,0

here's my advice ,0

this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . ,0

why ,0
this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy ,0
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie ,0
there's the plot ,0
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . ,0
this is amusing for about three minutes . ,0

"it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from "" promising "" to "" interesting "" to "" familiar "" before landing squarely on "" stupid "" . ",0
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script ,0
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence ,0
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . ,0
it won't harm anyone ,0
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . ,0
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece ,0
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . ,0

stale ,0
deadeningly dull ,0
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip ,0
like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . ,0
it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . ,0

another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . ,0
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls ,0

attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . ,0
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . ,0
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . ,0
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . ,0
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . ,0
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? ,0
this is so bad . ,0
even film silliness needs a little gravity ,0
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier ,0
prurient playthings aside ,0
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . ,0
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark ,0
it's played in the most straight-faced fashion ,0
van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . ,0
a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard ,0

there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . ,0
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs ,0
the humor isn't as sharp ,0
some of their jokes work ,0
even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . ,0
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special ,0
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so,0
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating ,0
the title not only describes its main characters ,0
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s ,0
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies ,0
demands too much of most viewers . ,0
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . ,0
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . ,0
shamelessly sappy and ,0
aggravating and tedious . ,0
the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . ,0
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it ,0
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island ,0
a clutchy ,0
meandering ,0
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . ,0
has the feel of an unedited personal journal . ,0

this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . ,0
it doesn't quite deserve the gong ,0
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . ,0
 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . ,0
unlike his directorial efforts ,0
the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than ,0
lacks depth . ,0
most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak ,0
there's no real reason to see it ,0
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . ,0
under-rehearsed and lifeless,0
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff ,0
you can practically smell the patchouli oil . ,0

it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull ,0
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . ,0
in the end ,0
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . ,0
a movie that ,0
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay ,0
imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . ,0
soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and ,0
a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal ,0
the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors,0
it may be a prize winner ,0
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem ,0
it's got its heart in the right place ,0
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . ,0

audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . ,0
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . ,0
it delivers some chills and sustained unease ,0
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . ,0

literally nothing in the pool is new ,0
arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . ,0
anyway ,0
chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . ,0
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . ,0
unwieldy contraption . ,0

marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . ,0

nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . ,0
